Hardcode out a map of string to number values.
Split the input on the new line
for each array item, split the string into two parts based on the middle item
loop over one of the parts, check if indexOf !== -1 for each character of the first part vs all the characters of the second part
when a find is made, break the loop and push the result to an array.
reduce over that array comparing with the hardcoded map and return the score for each, and adding to the total.
